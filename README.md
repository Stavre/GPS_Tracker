# GPS_Tracker


GPS tracker build using a raspberry pi zero and a GSM/GPRS/GNSS/Bluetooth HAT(modem 868). The software was written in python.

DO NOT USE FOR TIME SENSITIVE OR PRECISION SENSITIVE SITUATIONS.

Possible upgrades consist of rethinking the structure using OOP principle, using dedicated libraries(such as python-gsmmodem) and implementing a system for managing users.
